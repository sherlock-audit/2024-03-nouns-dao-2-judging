# Due to premature `forkEscrow` updates, the user will lose their escrow nouns

## Summary
Throughout the escrow phase, users have the option to deposit or retrieve their assets into forkHoldings. Additionally, actions outlined in proposals can be carried out during this time frame.

Due to premature `forkEscrow` updates, the user will lose their escrow nouns.

## Vulnerability Detail
The problem is that, if the DAO's escrow contract address (`forkEscrow`) is updated before the threshold for a successful fork (`forkThreshold`) is reached. This update can lead to a scenario where Nouns tokens escrowed in the original `forkEscrow` become inaccessible because the withdrawal mechanism exclusively interacts with the current `forkEscrow` address set in the DAO's storage.

## Impact
This flaw can have several detrimental impacts:
- **Loss of Tokens**: Users who have escrowed their Nouns tokens in anticipation of a fork may lose access to these tokens if the `forkEscrow` address is updated before the fork is finalized.
- **Reduced Trust**: The potential for token loss undermines trust in the DAO's governance mechanisms, potentially deterring participation in future proposals and escrow activities.
- **Governance Disruption**: The ability to change the `forkEscrow` address and impact escrowed tokens can be exploited to disrupt the governance process, particularly in sensitive periods of potential forking.

```solidity
    /**

     * Only allowed to withdraw tokens that the sender has escrowed.
     * @param tokenIds the tokenIds to withdraw
     */
    function withdrawFromForkEscrow(NounsDAOTypes.Storage storage ds, uint256[] calldata tokenIds) external {
        if (isForkPeriodActive(ds)) revert ForkPeriodActive();

        INounsDAOForkEscrow forkEscrow = ds.forkEscrow;
        forkEscrow.returnTokensToOwner(msg.sender, tokenIds);

        emit WithdrawFromForkEscrow(forkEscrow.forkId(), msg.sender, tokenIds);
    }

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I suggest several things:
1. Enable users to directly interact with the `forkEscrow` contract to withdraw their escrowed tokens. This reduces dependency on the DAO contract for escrow management.
2. Incorporate `isForkPeriodActive` checks within the `forkEscrow` contract's `returnTokensToOwner` function to centralize state validation and prevent premature withdrawal.
3. During active escrow periods leading up to a potential fork, consider making the `forkEscrow` address immutable or subject to stricter change controls, such as requiring a supermajority for updates.
