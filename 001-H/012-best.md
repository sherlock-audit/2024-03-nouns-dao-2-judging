# The upper limit of clientID of `Reward::registerClient` is type(uint32).max. This value is not large enough and can be reached by attackers by creating a large number of accounts, so that the clientID created by others will be revert

## Summary
The upper limit of clientID of `Reward::registerClient` is type(uint32).max. This value is not large enough and can be reached by attackers by creating a large number of accounts, so that the clientID created by others will be revert

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the comment "return uint32 the newly assigned clientId", it can be seen that the upper limit of clientID that `Reward::registerClient` can create is type(uint32).max. This number is not large. An attacker can reach this upper limit by creating a large number of accounts. This will cause the clientID created by others to be revert (in version 0.8.19, overflow will be revert), which means that the attacker can exclude other people from the auction, making the auction unable to proceed normally.

```solidity
/**
     * @notice Register a client, mints an NFT and assigns a clientId
     * @return uint32 the newly assigned clientId
     */
function registerClient(string calldata name, string calldata description) external whenNotPaused returns (uint32) {
        RewardsStorage storage $ = _getRewardsStorage();

        uint32 tokenId = $.nextTokenId;
        $.nextTokenId = tokenId + 1;
        _mint(msg.sender, tokenId);

        ClientMetadata storage md = $._clientMetadata[tokenId];
        md.name = name;
        md.description = description;

        emit ClientRegistered(tokenId, name, description);

        return tokenId;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation
Change tokenID, nextID, clientID and other related variable types to uint256
