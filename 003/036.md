# `NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol` - If `reservedPrice` is changed through an active auction, the auction still can be settled. This will result in losses for the NFT owner or auction bidder

## Summary
The `NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol` contract is designed to facilitate the auctioning of Nouns NFTs, playing a central role in the Nouns DAO ecosystem. This contract manages the entire lifecycle of an auction, from creation, bidding, to settlement. Each auction involves minting a new Noun NFT, setting it up for auction, accepting bids, and ultimately transferring the NFT to the highest bidder, with the process designed to be transparent and fair to all participants.

### Auction Process
1. **Auction Creation**: Initiated by the contract, often following the settlement of the previous auction. It involves minting the NFT and setting the auction parameters.
2. **Bidding**: Participants can place bids on the NFT, with each bid needing to be higher than the last by a specified minimum increment.
3. **Settlement**: Upon auction completion, the highest bidder wins the NFT. The contract then prepares for the next auction, repeating the cycle.

## Vulnerability Detail
The problem is that the `reservedPrice` parameter can be altered during an active auction. Since `reservedPrice` directly influences the validity of bids and the auction's outcome, changes to this parameter mid-auction can lead to unintended consequences. If the `reservedPrice` is increased, the NFT owner risks the auction settling below this new threshold, incurring a loss. Conversely, lowering the `reservedPrice` could lead to bidders overpaying based on the initial auction conditions.

## Impact
- **Owner Losses**: Increasing the `reservedPrice` mid-auction can result in the auction settling at a price below the newly set reserve, leading to potential losses for the NFT owner.
- **Bidder Overpayment**: Decreasing the `reservedPrice` during an auction can cause bidders to pay more than the updated reserve, potentially leading to bidder dissatisfaction and trust issues in the auction process.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
possible solution is to add a `whenPaused` modifier in the `setReservePrice()` function so that the `reservePrice` cannot be changed while there is an active auction.
