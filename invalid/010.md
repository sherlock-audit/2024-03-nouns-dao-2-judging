# The `newvotingdelay` of `NounsDAOAdmin::_setVotingDelay` cannot meet the needs mentioned in the comments

## Summary
The `newvotingdelay` of `NounsDAOAdmin::_setVotingDelay` cannot meet the needs mentioned in the comments

## Vulnerability Detail
In the comment, "Best to set voting delay to at least a few days, to give voters time to make sense of proposals, e.g. 21,600 blocks which should be at least 3 days."
But MAX_VOTING_DELAY_BLOCKS + MAX_VOTING_PERIOD_BLOCK = 2.56 days = 56 hours = 201600 seconds, which cannot meet the requirement of "at least a few days"

## Impact
The voters donâ€˜t have enough time to make sense of proposals

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation
If the comment is wrong,  201600 was incorrectly written as 21600, just modify the comment.
If it is not a comment error, it is recommended to increase the values of MAX_VOTING_DELAY_BLOCKS and MAX_VOTING_PERIOD_BLOCK to meet the needs
