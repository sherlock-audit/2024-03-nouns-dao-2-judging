# An auction  might be settled without meeting the reservePrice requirement.

## Summary
An auction  might be settled without meeting the ``reservePrice`` requirement.  The main reason is that  the admin can change the  parameters of an on-going auction: ``timeBuffer``, ``reservePrice``, and ``minBidIncrementPercentage``. These parameters should have been fixed for an ongoing auction and their updates should only be applied to the next auction. As a result, for example, some undesirable behavior might occur, such as even when an acution is settled, the reservePrice requirement is not satisfied. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the following scenario: 
1. Suppose initially ``reservePrice`` = 0.2 ether;
2. The first bidder A bids for 0.2 ether and  becomes the winning bidder. 
3. The admin changes ``reservePrice`` = 0.3 ether, which means, the auction can only be settled with a minium bidding value of 0.3 ether.
4. Suppose no later bidders with a value of >= 0.3 ether. 
5. As a result, A wins the auction with 0.2 ether. However, this does not satisfy the ``reservePrice`` requirement. 

## Impact
An auction  might be settled without meeting the ``reservePrice`` requirement.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The three parameters of an auction: ``timeBuffer``, ``reservePrice``, and ``minBidIncrementPercentage`` should be intialized at function `` _createAuction()`` and then fixed during the whole liftime of the auction.
