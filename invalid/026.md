# An important proposal can expire during the forking period.

## Summary
Succeeded `proposals` move to the `timelock` for `execution`.
During the `grace period`, they can only be executed.
After this `grace period`, `proposals` expire.
And during the `forking period`, no `proposals` can be executed.
Some important `proposals` might expire due to the `overlapping` `grace period` and `forking period`.
Then we need to recreate the same `proposal` and gather `votes` again.
However, this process takes time, and there is no guarantee they will pass again.
## Vulnerability Detail
We can only execute the `proposals` during the `grace period` in the `timelock`.
```solidity
function executeTransaction(
    address target,
    uint256 value,
    string memory signature,
    bytes memory data,
    uint256 eta
) public returns (bytes memory) {
    require(
        getBlockTimestamp() >= eta,
        "NounsDAOExecutor::executeTransaction: Transaction hasn't surpassed time lock."
    );
    require(
        getBlockTimestamp() <= eta + GRACE_PERIOD,
        'NounsDAOExecutor::executeTransaction: Transaction is stale.'
    );
}
```
During the `forking period`, executing `proposals` is not possible.
```solidity
function executeInternal(
    NounsDAOTypes.Storage storage ds,
    NounsDAOTypes.Proposal storage proposal,
    INounsDAOExecutor timelock
) internal {
    if (ds.isForkPeriodActive()) revert CannotExecuteDuringForkingPeriod();
}
```
As a result, some `proposals` may expire even though they are eligible for execution.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the execute `proposal` call is invoked during the `forking period`, we can extend the `eta` of it to the end of the `forking period`.
