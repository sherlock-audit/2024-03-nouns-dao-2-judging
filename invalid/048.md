# user who doesn't have vote power can votes

## Summary
Function `NounsDAOVotes.castVoteInternal` doesn't check if `voter` has vote power. With checking if the voter has vote power, a malicious user can extend a proposal's `endBlock` in some case.

## Vulnerability Detail
I will take [NounsDAOLogicV4.castVote](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/8f6879efaf831eb7fc9d4a4ad2b62b5334220d87/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/NounsDAOLogicV4.sol#L657-L659) as an example.
With in `NounsDAOLogicV4.castVote`, [NounsDAOVotes.castVote](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/8f6879efaf831eb7fc9d4a4ad2b62b5334220d87/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/NounsDAOVotes.sol#L70-L72) is called. And then [NounsDAOVotes.castVoteInternal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/8f6879efaf831eb7fc9d4a4ad2b62b5334220d87/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/NounsDAOVotes.sol#L193-L216) is called.

In `NounsDAOVotes.castVoteInternal`:
```solidity
193     function castVoteInternal(
194         NounsDAOTypes.Storage storage ds,
195         address voter,
196         uint256 proposalId,
197         uint8 support,
198         uint32 clientId
199     ) internal returns (uint96 votes) {
200         NounsDAOTypes.ProposalState proposalState = ds.stateInternal(proposalId);
201 
202         if (proposalState == NounsDAOTypes.ProposalState.Active) {
203             votes = castVoteDuringVotingPeriodInternal(ds, proposalId, voter, support);
204         } else if (proposalState == NounsDAOTypes.ProposalState.ObjectionPeriod) {
205             if (support != 0) revert CanOnlyVoteAgainstDuringObjectionPeriod();
206             votes = castObjectionInternal(ds, proposalId, voter);
207         } else {
208             revert('NounsDAO::castVoteInternal: voting is closed');
209         }
210 
211         NounsDAOTypes.ClientVoteData memory voteData = ds._proposals[proposalId].voteClients[clientId];
212         ds._proposals[proposalId].voteClients[clientId] = NounsDAOTypes.ClientVoteData({
213             votes: uint32(voteData.votes + votes),
214             txs: voteData.txs + 1
215         });
216     }
```
1. Supposed the proposal's state is `NounsDAOTypes.ProposalState.Active`
In such case, [NounsDAOVotes.sol#L203](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/8f6879efaf831eb7fc9d4a4ad2b62b5334220d87/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/NounsDAOVotes.sol#L203) is executed.
In [NounsDAOVotes.castVoteDuringVotingPeriodInternal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/8f6879efaf831eb7fc9d4a4ad2b62b5334220d87/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/NounsDAOVotes.sol#L226-L278), the function calls [ds.nouns.getPriorVotes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/8f6879efaf831eb7fc9d4a4ad2b62b5334220d87/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/NounsDAOVotes.sol#L237C24-L237C46) to get the voter's voting power. And then [objectionPeriodEndBlock](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/8f6879efaf831eb7fc9d4a4ad2b62b5334220d87/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/NounsDAOVotes.sol#L267-L269) is updated if the [conditions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/8f6879efaf831eb7fc9d4a4ad2b62b5334220d87/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/NounsDAOVotes.sol#L255-L266) are met

    **But the issue is that the function doesn't check if the voter has voting power, so anyone can call this function to extend `objectionPeriodEndBlock`**

2. another issue about the zero voting-power is in [NounsDAOVotes.sol#L214](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/8f6879efaf831eb7fc9d4a4ad2b62b5334220d87/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/NounsDAOVotes.sol#L214) `txs: voteData.txs + 1` is updated. 
If a user doesn't have voting power, `voteData.txs` shouldn't be updated.

## Impact
Some proposals' end time can be extended by users who don't have voting power, and the proposals' state isn't correct
