# Absence of penalties for erroneus clients as client could frontrun disapproval, takes out rewards before he could be prevented from doing so

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

When a client register for client participation rewards, the DAO has a responsibility to approve or deny the request. To approve or disapprove, the DAO has to call [`Rewards::setClientApproval()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/client-incentives/Rewards.sol#L629C1-L633C6). This process helps DAO to keep the clients in check and accountable. This makes this functionality really important. 

Say a malicious client is flagged by the DAO, they have a responsibility of revoking the approval of the client. Doing this means the client will effectively be unable to withdraw the rewards they have accumulated. This is where front-running comes in. If the malicious client notices that they have been made, and a disapprove call has been sent to contract, he can front run the tx call. This causes issues for the protocol because then the malicious client would not exactly be held accountable for any inconsistencies casued by them.

## Impact

Lack of accountability and repercussion on the part on the DAO to the client. The client can still withdraw the rewards he has garnered over time

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function setClientApproval(uint32 clientId, bool approved) public onlyOwner {
        RewardsStorage storage $ = _getRewardsStorage();
        $._clientMetadata[clientId].approved = approved;
        emit ClientApprovalSet(clientId, approved);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make the client rewards withdrawal process a timelock where withdrawals can only be made after a certain time has passed. Plus, any client can be removed with this delay period. This way the malicious actor will be unable to make immediate withdraw.
