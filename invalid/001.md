# DAO updating forkEscrow before forkThreshold is reaches causes user's escrowed Nouns to be lost

## Summary
If the DAO changes the `ds().forkEscrow` using `NounsDAOAdmin._setForkEscrow()` this will cause `NounsDAOFork.withdrawFromForkEscrow()` to call the new `forkEscrow` locking all Nouns in the previous `forkEscrow`.

## Vulnerability Detail
During the escrow period, users can deposit, [NounsDAOFork.escrowToFork()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/fork/NounsDAOFork.sol#L74-L88), or withdraw, [NounsDAOFork.withdrawFromForkEscrow()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/fork/NounsDAOFork.sol#L95-L102) their nouns.
The DAO can also pass proposals during the escrow period, which means that `NounsDAOAdmin._setForkEscrow()` can be used to change `ds().forkEscrow`.

[NounsDAOLogicV4.sol#L571-L573](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/NounsDAOLogicV4.sol#L571-L573)
```solidity
    function withdrawFromForkEscrow(uint256[] calldata tokenIds) external {
        ds.withdrawFromForkEscrow(tokenIds);
    }
```

`NounsDAOFork.withdrawFromForkEscrow()` is called from `NounsDAOLogicV4.withdrawFromForkEscrow()`, meaning users are not able to pass in their own `ds` value and can only use the one that is currently set, which as mentioned can be changed with a proposal during the escrow period.

[NounsDAOFork.sol#L95-L102](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/fork/NounsDAOFork.sol#L95-L102)
```solidity
    function withdrawFromForkEscrow(NounsDAOTypes.Storage storage ds, uint256[] calldata tokenIds) external {
        if (isForkPeriodActive(ds)) revert ForkPeriodActive(); 

        INounsDAOForkEscrow forkEscrow = ds.forkEscrow;
        forkEscrow.returnTokensToOwner(msg.sender, tokenIds);

        emit WithdrawFromForkEscrow(forkEscrow.forkId(), msg.sender, tokenIds);
    }
```

`NounsDAOFork.withdrawFromForkEscrow()` calls `forkEscrow.returnTokensToOwner()` for `ds.forkEscrow` and `returnTokensToOwner` can only be called by the DAO. 

[NounsDAOForkEscrow.sol#L116-L125](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/fork/NounsDAOForkEscrow.sol#L116-L125)
```solidity
    function returnTokensToOwner(address owner, uint256[] calldata tokenIds) external onlyDAO {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds.length; i++) {
            if (currentOwnerOf(tokenIds[i]) != owner) revert NotOwner();

            nounsToken.transferFrom(address(this), owner, tokenIds[i]);
            escrowedTokensByForkId[forkId][tokenIds[i]] = address(0);
        }

        numTokensInEscrow -= tokenIds.length;
    }
```

[NounsDAOAdmin.sol#L473-L477](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/NounsDAOAdmin.sol#L473-L477)
```solidity
    function _setForkEscrow(address newForkEscrow) public onlyAdmin {
        emit ForkEscrowSet(address(ds().forkEscrow), newForkEscrow);

        ds().forkEscrow = INounsDAOForkEscrow(newForkEscrow);
    }
```

Meaning that if `ds().forkEscrow` is changed by the DAO using `NounsDAOAdmin._setForkEscrow()` then users will be unable to unescrow their Nouns as they will be unable to call the `returnTokensToOwner()` function themselves and `withdrawFromForkEscrow` will now interact with the new ds().forkEscrow`. This finding was reported previously during the code4rena audit in July 2023, where it was acknowledged but has not been resolved.

## Impact
Users may lose their Nouns if ds().forkEscrow is changed by a DAO proposal. This change would prevent withdrawal as returnTokensToOwner() can only be called by the DAO. If ds().forkEscrow is changed, the DAO cannot call it using withdrawFromForkEscrow.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

One solution would be to store previous escrows within `NounsDAOLogicV4.sol` and create a sister function similar to [NounsDAOLogicV4.withdrawFromForkEscrow()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/NounsDAOLogicV4.sol#L571-L573) but allowing users to choose an older escrow to withdraw their Nouns from.

Another solution would be to allow users to call `forkEscrow.returnTokensToOwner()` directly by changing the function modifier whilst also conducting the `isForkPeriodActive(ds))` check. Although this file is out of scope, the issue involves `NounsDAOAdmin.sol`, `NounsDAOFork.sol` and `NounsDAOLogicV4.sol`, which are within the scope of this audit.
