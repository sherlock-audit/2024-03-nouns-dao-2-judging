# `Rewards.getVotingClientIds` doesn't consistent with `Rewards.updateRewardsForProposalWritingAndVoting`

## Summary
`Rewards.getVotingClientIds` is used to return the clientIds that are needed to be passed as a parameter to `Rewards.updateRewardsForProposalWritingAndVoting`, without this helper function, it will be impossible for non-tech user to get the correct clientIds, 
In current implementation, there is a special case the function doesn't return the correct clientIds, which will causes `Rewards.updateRewardsForProposalWritingAndVoting` revert

## Vulnerability Detail
In [Rewards.getVotingClientIds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/8f6879efaf831eb7fc9d4a4ad2b62b5334220d87/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/client-incentives/Rewards.sol#L494-L526), the function fetch all the clientIds from `$.nextProposalIdToReward` to `lastProposalId` in [Rewards.sol#L502-L506](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/8f6879efaf831eb7fc9d4a4ad2b62b5334220d87/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/client-incentives/Rewards.sol#L502-L506)
And then filter **all the clientIds** those have been used in [Rewards.sol#L508-L519](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/8f6879efaf831eb7fc9d4a4ad2b62b5334220d87/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/client-incentives/Rewards.sol#L508-L519)

The issue is that when those clientIds passed into [Rewards.updateRewardsForProposalWritingAndVoting](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/8f6879efaf831eb7fc9d4a4ad2b62b5334220d87/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/client-incentives/Rewards.sol#L307-L449), the function will delete some proposal in [Rewards.sol#L358-L361](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/8f6879efaf831eb7fc9d4a4ad2b62b5334220d87/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/client-incentives/Rewards.sol#L358-L361).

If a `clientIdX` is used only once for a proposalX(and the `clientIdX` is not used for the rest proposals), and the proposalX is deleted in [Rewards.sol#L358-L361](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/8f6879efaf831eb7fc9d4a4ad2b62b5334220d87/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/client-incentives/Rewards.sol#L358-L361) because of `proposals[i].forVotes < (proposals[i].totalSupply * proposalEligibilityQuorumBps_`, in such case, the function will revert in [Rewards.sol#L438-L438](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/8f6879efaf831eb7fc9d4a4ad2b62b5334220d87/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/client-incentives/Rewards.sol#L438-L438) because `didClientIdHaveVotes[clientIdX]` is **0**



## Impact
In current implementation, there is a special case the function doesn't return the correct clientIds, which will causes `Rewards.updateRewardsForProposalWritingAndVoting` revert
