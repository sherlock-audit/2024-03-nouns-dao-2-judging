# `NounsDAOProposals.sol` contract: Description and Transactions of proposals can be changed post-submission

## Summary
The Nouns DAO protocol uses an advanced governance model, allowing token holders to propose, vote and implement changes to the ecosystem. This model is built around proposals that encapsulate changes ranging from minor tweaks in protocol parameters to significant financial allocations from the DAO treasury. Each proposal goes through a life cycle from creation, through a voting period, to implementation if approved. The integrity of this process is vital to maintaining trust, ensuring community interests are fairly represented, and protecting protocol assets.

## Vulnerability Detail
The problem is that the Nouns DAO governance logic, specifically within the `NounsDAOProposals.sol` contract, allow proposers to update the description and transactions of proposals post-submission. While intended to improve the user experience by incorporating voter feedback directly into the suggestion engine, this feature inadvertently introduces risk. Voters who vote based on initial versions of proposals may not be aware of subsequent material changes, potentially leading to the approval of proposals that are no longer consistent with their original intent.

## Impact
Malicious proposers could exploit this feature to initially present benign proposals, gather support, then alter the proposal's intent or financial allocations to serve their interests.
Awareness of the potential for proposal manipulation could lead to decreased participation in the voting process, undermining the governance model's legitimacy.
Significant treasury assets could be misallocated or stolen if proposals with hidden or late-stage changes are executed, leading to financial loss and reputational damage.
The execution of materially altered proposals, especially those involving financial transactions, could expose the DAO to legal and regulatory scrutiny.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Several mitigations can be done here:
- Implement a feature that prevents any modifications to proposals once the first vote has been cast. This ensures that early voters and late voters are making decisions based on the same information.
- Introduce a versioning system for proposals that undergo modifications before voting begins, along with a transparent change log. This allows voters to review the history of changes before casting their votes.
- Develop a robust notification system that alerts voters of any changes to proposals they've interacted with or expressed interest in, ensuring they are fully informed before making voting decisions.
- Extend the minimum voting delay to a period that allows sufficient time for voters to notice and evaluate updated proposal details, potentially several days, to ensure that updates do not unfairly influence the voting outcome.
