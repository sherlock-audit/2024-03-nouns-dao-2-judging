# The auction duration is significantly shorter than expected when the contract is paused

## Summary

When the `NounsAuctionHouseV2` contract is *paused*, the current auction is still ongoing, but no one is able to continue bidding. In extreme cases, if a bidder places a bid and the contract is then paused until the current auction ends, that bidder may win the auction at an extremely low price, which is unfair to other bidders.

## Vulnerability Detail

The current contract can settle auctions even when in a paused state, which could lead to potential issues.

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Settle the current auction.
     * @dev This function can only be called when the contract is paused.
     */
    function settleAuction() external override whenPaused {
        _settleAuction();
    }
```

Please consider the following scenario:

There are two bidders, *bidder1* and *bidder2*, competing for the current nounId. Its value is approximately 10 USD, and the bidding time is 1 hour. 

The *bidder1* bids 1 USD first, followed by *bidder2* bidding 2 USD. At this point, some emergencies occur, and the owner pauses the entire contract. However, the auction continues despite the contract suspension, leaving no opportunity for further bidding due to the contract's suspension.

In extreme cases, if the contract suspension persists until the end of the auction, which is 1 hour later, *bidder2* can directly settle the auction and acquire the nounId at a price of 2 USD, while other bidders lose the opportunity to participate in bidding.

I believe this situation has affected the core functionality of the contract, and it is crucial to address this boundary scenario appropriately.

**POC**
Add the test to `nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/test/foundry/NounsAuctionHouseV2.t.sol` and run it with `forge test --match-test test_settleAuction_After_pause --ffi`

## Impact

Bidders may successfully bid at prices significantly lower than the average, thus profiting from the total proceeds.
