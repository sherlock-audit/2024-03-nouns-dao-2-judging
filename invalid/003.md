# Unable to set the minimum proposal threshold

## Summary
Collections with high total supply NFT will not be able to set the minimum proposal threshold.
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol assures that the `proposalThresholdBPS` can be setted at least = 1, which means that at least 1 basis point is enough to reach the minimum proposal threshold:
```solidity
/// @notice The minimum setable proposal threshold
    uint256 public constant MIN_PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD_BPS = 1;  // 1 basis point or 0.01%

/**
     * @notice Admin function for setting the proposal threshold basis points
     * @dev newProposalThresholdBPS must be in [`MIN_PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD_BPS`,`MAX_PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD_BPS`]
     * @param newProposalThresholdBPS new proposal threshold
     */
    function _setProposalThresholdBPS(uint256 newProposalThresholdBPS) external onlyAdmin {
        require(
            newProposalThresholdBPS >= MIN_PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD_BPS &&
                newProposalThresholdBPS <= MAX_PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD_BPS,
            'NounsDAO::_setProposalThreshold: invalid proposal threshold bps'
        );
        //...
    }
```
```solidity
/// @notice The number of votes needed to create a proposal at the time of proposal creation. *DIFFERS from GovernerBravo
        uint256 proposalThreshold;
```
However, collections with at least 20000 NFTs in total supply can’t set proposal threshold = 1. If totalSupply = 20000, with the lowest settings (`ds().proposalThresholdBPS` = 1), it would returns (20000 * 1) / 10000 = 2:
```solidity
temp.propThreshold = proposalThreshold(ds, temp.adjustedTotalSupply);
```
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Current proposal threshold using Noun Total Supply
     * Differs from `GovernerBravo` which uses fixed amount
     */
    function proposalThreshold(
        NounsDAOTypes.Storage storage ds,
        uint256 adjustedTotalSupply
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        return bps2Uint(ds.proposalThresholdBPS, adjustedTotalSupply); 
    }

    function bps2Uint(uint256 bps, uint256 number) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        return (number * bps) / 10000;
    }
```
And it can’t be lowered more. Moreover,  even if  proposal threshold = 2, proposal in `proposeBySigs()` function will revert even if votes = 2, not lower than `temp.propThreshold`, which defies logic of protocol's proposal thresholds. 
```solidity
temp.propThreshold = proposalThreshold(ds, temp.adjustedTotalSupply);

if (votes <= temp.propThreshold) revert VotesBelowProposalThreshold();  // if votes = 2 revert, must be at least 3
```
All of this breaks the protocol's internal logic and cannot be design choise. 
## Impact
Collections with at least 20000 NFTs in total supply will not be able to set the minimum proposal threshold to lowest values.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Increase division to a more precise value such as 1e18 to allow collections with high total supply NFT to always set any allowed threshold, even 1:
```diff
function bps2Uint(uint256 bps, uint256 number) internal pure returns (uint256) {
-       return (number * bps) / 10000;
+       return (number * bps) / 1e18;
    }
```
And proposal must not revert if `votes` = `propThreshold`, not below threshold:
```diff
-     if (votes <= propThreshold) revert VotesBelowProposalThreshold();
+     if (votes < propThreshold) revert VotesBelowProposalThreshold();
```
