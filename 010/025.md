# Winning bid funds transfer is not checked for success or failure, so that the `_auction.amount` can be lost.

## Summary

Function `_safeTransferETHWithFallback` transfers the funds of winning bid to DAO, but does not return any boolean value. If the transfer fails, funds will never be added to DAO.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. When an auction is settled by `NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol::_settleAuction`, the winning bid is payed by `NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol::_safeTransferETHWithFallback`.
[nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L288](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L288)
```javascript
    if (_auction.amount > 0) {
@>      _safeTransferETHWithFallback(owner(), _auction.amount);
    }
```

2. `_safeTransferETHWithFallback` is void, there is no boolean value returned. In case the transfer of the funds fails, the auction is settled normally, but without any funds entering DAO.
[nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L304-L309](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L304-L309)
```javascript
    function _safeTransferETHWithFallback(address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (!_safeTransferETH(to, amount)) {
            IWETH(weth).deposit{ value: amount }();
            IERC20(weth).transfer(to, amount);
        }
    }
```
3. This issue is also valid for the contract `NounsAuctionHouse.sol`, instead of `NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol`, which is described here.

## Impact

Auction winning bid funds getting lost, if the transfer fails.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Change `NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol::_safeTransferETHWithFallback` to return a boolean.
```diff
-    function _safeTransferETHWithFallback(address to, uint256 amount) internal {
+    function _safeTransferETHWithFallback(address to, uint256 amount) internal returns(bool) {
         if (!_safeTransferETH(to, amount)) {
             IWETH(weth).deposit{ value: amount }();
-            IERC20(weth).transfer(to, amount);
+            return IERC20(weth).transfer(to, amount);
         }
+        return true;
     }
```
2. Check if `_safeTransferETHWithFallback` has succeeded, by a require or revert.
```diff
    if (_auction.amount > 0) {
-       _safeTransferETHWithFallback(owner(), _auction.amount);
+       bool success = _safeTransferETHWithFallback(owner(), _auction.amount);
+       require(success, "Bid funds transfer failed.");
    }
```
