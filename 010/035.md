# Not winning bid funds refund is not checked for success or failure, so that any previous bid `_auction.amount` can be lost.

## Summary

Function `_safeTransferETHWithFallback` refunds the previous bid amount, of latest bigger one, to bidder, but does not return any boolean value. If the transfer fails, funds will never be refunded.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. When a bigger bid is created by `NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol::createBid`, the previous winning bid is payed back by `NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol::_safeTransferETHWithFallback`.
[nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L165](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L165)
```javascript
    if (lastBidder != address(0)) {
@>       _safeTransferETHWithFallback(lastBidder, _auction.amount);
    }
```

2. `_safeTransferETHWithFallback` is void, there is no boolean value returned. In case the transfer of the funds fails, the auction continues normally, but without any funds returned to last bidder.
[nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L304-L309](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L304-L309)
```javascript
    function _safeTransferETHWithFallback(address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (!_safeTransferETH(to, amount)) {
            IWETH(weth).deposit{ value: amount }();
            IERC20(weth).transfer(to, amount);
        }
    }
```

3. This issue is also valid for the contract NounsAuctionHouse.sol, instead of NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol, which is described here.

## Impact

Previous bid funds, can be trapped in DAO, when a bigger bid happens, if the refund transfer fails.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Change `NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol::_safeTransferETHWithFallback` to return a boolean.
```diff
-    function _safeTransferETHWithFallback(address to, uint256 amount) internal {
+    function _safeTransferETHWithFallback(address to, uint256 amount) internal returns(bool) {
         if (!_safeTransferETH(to, amount)) {
             IWETH(weth).deposit{ value: amount }();
-            IERC20(weth).transfer(to, amount);
+            return IERC20(weth).transfer(to, amount);
         }
+        return true;
     }
```

2. Check if `_safeTransferETHWithFallback` has succeeded.
```diff
+   event ClientBidRefund(address indexed lastBidder, uint256 amount, bool success);
+
    if (lastBidder != address(0)) {
-        _safeTransferETHWithFallback(lastBidder, _auction.amount);
+        bool success = _safeTransferETHWithFallback(lastBidder, _auction.amount);
+        emit ClientBidRefund(lastBidder, _auction.amount, success);
    }
```

A revert could be triggered here, when this transfer fails, but maybe it's too much. By emitting an event the DAO knows, if the funds were really transferred, to correct the issue.
