# Gas Refunds can be lost

## Summary
Due to the usage of `tx.origin` when handling gas, refunds meant for a smart contract wallet will be lost.
## Vulnerability Detail
There are two places where gas refunds are handled, either in `native ETH`:
```javascript
    function _refundGas(uint256 startGas) internal {
        unchecked {
            uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
            if (balance == 0) {
                return;
            }
            uint256 basefee = min(block.basefee, MAX_REFUND_BASE_FEE);
            uint256 gasPrice = min(tx.gasprice, basefee + MAX_REFUND_PRIORITY_FEE);
            uint256 gasUsed = min(startGas - gasleft() + REFUND_BASE_GAS, MAX_REFUND_GAS_USED);
            uint256 refundAmount = min(gasPrice * gasUsed, balance);
            (bool refundSent, ) = tx.origin.call{ value: refundAmount }('');
            emit RefundableVote(tx.origin, refundAmount, refundSent);
        }
    }
```

or in `ethToken`:
```javascript
    /// @dev refunds gas using the `ethToken` instead of ETH
    function refundGas(IERC20 ethToken, uint256 startGas) internal {
        unchecked {
            uint256 balance = ethToken.balanceOf(address(this));
            if (balance == 0) {
                return;
            }
            uint256 basefee = min(block.basefee, MAX_REFUND_BASE_FEE);
            uint256 gasPrice = min(tx.gasprice, basefee + MAX_REFUND_PRIORITY_FEE);
            uint256 gasUsed = startGas - gasleft() + REFUND_BASE_GAS;
            uint256 refundAmount = min(gasPrice * gasUsed, balance);
            ethToken.safeTransfer(tx.origin, refundAmount);
        }
    }
```

The problem here lays in the usage of `tx.origin`. 
There is a clear direction on the Ethereum mainnet to move from EOA's to Smart Contract Wallets. The project is aware of this because, for example, they use `isValidSignatureNow`:
```javascript
    /**
     * @dev Checks if a signature is valid for a given signer and data hash. If the signer is a smart contract, the
     * signature is validated against that smart contract using ERC1271, otherwise it's validated using `ECDSA.recover`.
     *
     * NOTE: Unlike ECDSA signatures, contract signatures are revocable, and the outcome of this function can thus
     * change through time. It could return true at block N and false at block N+1 (or the opposite).
     */
    function isValidSignatureNow(
        address signer,
        bytes32 hash,
        bytes memory signature
    ) internal view returns (bool) {
        (address recovered, ECDSA.RecoverError error) = ECDSA.tryRecover(hash, signature);
        return
            (error == ECDSA.RecoverError.NoError && recovered == signer) ||
            isValidERC1271SignatureNow(signer, hash, signature);
    }
```
Which also provides the functionality for contract signatures to be validated.

However, in the case of the two examples of gas refunds, these get sent to the `tx.origin`. When a smart contract wallet interacts with this protocol, the smart contract wallet will not be the `tx.origin` due to the nature of Account Abstraction, which means the refund will go to the wrong address since `tx.origin` will not be the smart contract wallet.
## Impact
This results in gas refund funds lost.
