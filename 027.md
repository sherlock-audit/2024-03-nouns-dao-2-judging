# `Rewards.sol` has utilized vulnerable openzeppelin `4.1.0` UUPS implementation which has critical vulnerability

## Summary
`Rewards.sol` has utilized vulnerable openzeppelin `4.1.0` UUPS implementation which has critical vulnerability

## Vulnerability Detail

Openzeppelin has found the critical severity bug in `UUPSUpgradeable`. The nouns dao contracts has used both openzeppelin contracts as well as openzeppelin upgrabable contracts with version v4.1.0. This is confirmed from package.json and can be checked [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/package.json#L33)

According to openzeppelin, The UUPSUpgradeable vulnerability has been found in openzeppelin version as follows,
> @openzeppelin/contracts : Affected versions >= 4.1.0 < 4.3.2
> @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable : >= 4.1.0 < 4.3.2

Openzeppelin has fixed this issue in versions `4.3.2`. However, Nouns dao contracts falls in above affected versions.

`Rewards.sol` contract has been affected due to this vulnerability as `Rewards.sol` is an UUPSUpgradeable contract. 

```solidity

`Rewards.sol` utilizes this vulnerable UUPS implementation and this contains the critical vulnerability that uninitialized implementations can be [hijacked](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/security/advisories/GHSA-q4h9-46xg-m3x9) and completely bricked.

## Additional details

According to [UUPSUpgradeable Vulnerability Post-mortem](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/uupsupgradeable-vulnerability-post-mortem/15680) which is published by openzeppelin states,

> The vulnerability lies in the DELEGATECALL instructions in the upgrade function, exposed by the UUPSUpgradeable base contract. As described [here 164](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#potentially-unsafe-operations), a DELEGATECALL can be exploited by an attacker by having the implementation contract call into another contract that SELFDESTRUCTs itself, causing the caller to be destroyed.

> Given an UUPS implementation contract, an attacker can [initialize it 173](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#initializers) and appoint themselves as upgrade administrators. This allows them to call the [upgradeToAndCall 88](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#UUPSUpgradeable-upgradeToAndCall-address-bytes-) function on the implementation directly, instead of on the proxy, and use it to DELEGATECALL into a malicious contract with a SELFDESTRUCT operation.

>If the attack is successful, any proxy contracts backed by this implementation become unusable, as any calls to them are delegated to an address with no executable code. Furthermore, since the upgrade logic resided in the implementation and not the proxy, it is not possible to upgrade the proxy to a valid implementation. This effectively bricks the contract, and impedes access to any assets held on it.

## Impact
Upgradeable contracts using UUPSUpgradeable are  vulnerable to an attack affecting uninitialized implementation contracts.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1) Update the openzeppelin library to latest version or preferabley v4.3.0 or above.
2) Check [this](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/security-advisory-initialize-uups-implementation-contracts/15301) openzeppelin security advisory to initialize the UUPS implementation contracts.
3) Check [this](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy) openzeppelin UUPS documentation.

3) At sherlock, the issue is valid under below rule,
> In case the vulnerability exists in a library and an in-scope contract uses it and is affected by this bug this is a valid issue.
