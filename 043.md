# Bid can go on to infinite as we can use createBid to add bid in Buffertime.

## Summary
 Bid can go on to infinite as we can use createBid to add bid in Buffertime.
## Vulnerability Detail
function createBid(uint256 nounId) external payable override nonReentrant {
        INounsAuctionHouse.Auction memory _auction = auction;

        require(_auction.nounId == nounId, 'Noun not up for auction');
        require(block.timestamp < _auction.endTime, 'Auction expired');
        require(msg.value >= reservePrice, 'Must send at least reservePrice');
        require(
            msg.value >= _auction.amount + ((_auction.amount * minBidIncrementPercentage) / 100),
            'Must send more than last bid by minBidIncrementPercentage amount'
        );

        address payable lastBidder = _auction.bidder;

        // Refund the last bidder, if applicable
        if (lastBidder != address(0)) {
            _safeTransferETHWithFallback(lastBidder, _auction.amount);
        }

        auction.amount = msg.value;
        auction.bidder = payable(msg.sender);

        // Extend the auction if the bid was received within `timeBuffer` of the auction end time
 @>       bool extended = _auction.endTime - block.timestamp < timeBuffer;
        if (extended) {
     @>       auction.endTime = _auction.endTime = block.timestamp + timeBuffer;
        }

        emit AuctionBid(_auction.nounId, msg.sender, msg.value, extended);

        if (extended) {
            emit AuctionExtended(_auction.nounId, _auction.endTime);
        }
    }
## Impact
 Bid can go on to infinite as we can use createBid to add bid in Buffertime.

## Recommendation
use a mapping so that the same old addresss can be used again in  Buffertime.
