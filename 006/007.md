# Some voters will not be rewarded

## Summary
Some voters who voted for the proposals will not be rewarded.
## Vulnerability Detail
The only reasons why a voter cannot be rewarded is this:
```solidity
// @param votingClientIds array of sorted client ids that were used to vote on the eligible proposals in
// this rewards distribution. reverts if contains duplicates. reverts if not sorted. reverts if a clientId had zero votes.
```
In other cases voter must be rewarded. But if voter submitted votes using functions `castVoteBySig()`, `castVoteWithReason()` or `castVote()`, he will not get rewards due to hardcoded `clientId`:
```solidity
function castVote(NounsDAOTypes.Storage storage ds, uint256 proposalId, uint8 support) external {
        emit VoteCast(msg.sender, proposalId, support, castVoteInternal(ds, msg.sender, proposalId, support, 0), '');
    }

function castVoteInternal(
        NounsDAOTypes.Storage storage ds,
        address voter,
        uint256 proposalId,
        uint8 support,
 -->    uint32 clientId   <--
    ) internal returns (uint96 votes) {

        //...

        NounsDAOTypes.ClientVoteData memory voteData = ds._proposals[proposalId].voteClients[clientId];
        ds._proposals[proposalId].voteClients[clientId] = NounsDAOTypes.ClientVoteData({
            votes: uint32(voteData.votes + votes),
            txs: voteData.txs + 1
        });
    }
```
Votes by varriable `clientId` are saved in array, that will be used for rewards accounting in `Rewards.sol`:
```solidity
NounsDAOTypes.ClientVoteData[] memory voteData = proposals[i].voteData;
            for (uint256 j; j < votingClientIds.length; ++j) {
                clientId = votingClientIds[j];
                uint256 votes = voteData[j].votes;
                didClientIdHaveVotes[j] = didClientIdHaveVotes[j] || votes > 0; 
                if (clientId != 0 && clientId <= t.maxClientId) {
                    m.inc(clientId, votes * t.rewardPerVote);
                }
                votesInProposal += votes;
            }
```
As we can see, voters with `clientId = 0` will not be rewarded. It was made to avoid rewarding non-existed `clientId`(=0 or > maxClientId), but in reality it harms voters with existing `clientId`, because they was not allowed to pass it as a parameter in `castVote()` and other functions.
## Impact
Many elgibile voters who voted for the elgibile proposals will not be rewarded.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow users to pass `clientId` as a parameter in `castVote()` and other functions:
```diff
function castVote(
           NounsDAOTypes.Storage storage ds, 
           uint256 proposalId,  
           uint8 support,
+          uint32 clientId
   ) external {
-        emit VoteCast(msg.sender, proposalId, support, castVoteInternal(ds, msg.sender, proposalId, support, 0), '');
+        emit VoteCast(msg.sender, proposalId, support, castVoteInternal(ds, msg.sender, proposalId, support, clientId), '');
    }
```
