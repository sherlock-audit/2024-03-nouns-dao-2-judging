# The uint96 Overflow Issue Preventing New Auction Initiations (Auction ID Limitation)

## Summary
The Nouns DAO protocol and similar blockchain-based systems often employ auction mechanisms for various purposes, such as distributing NFTs or governance tokens. These auctions are typically managed through smart contracts that assign unique identifiers (IDs) to each auction. A potential bug has been identified in systems where auction IDs are restricted to `uint96` data types, potentially limiting the number of auctions that can be initiated.

## Vulnerability Detail
The core of this vulnerability lies in the use of a `uint96` data type for auction IDs. While `uint96` allows for a significantly large range of values, systems with a high frequency of auctions or those intended to operate over an extended period could theoretically exceed this range. Once the `uint96` maximum value is reached, the system would be unable to assign unique IDs to new auctions, effectively preventing the initiation of further auctions.

## Impact
The practical impact of this bug depends on the scale and operational parameters of the affected system:
- **Operational Disruption**: In systems approaching the `uint96` limit, the inability to start new auctions could halt critical operations, affecting liquidity, user engagement, and overall platform functionality.
- **Long-Term Scalability**: For protocols envisioning long-term operation or those with high auction frequencies, hitting this limit could necessitate significant restructuring or migration efforts to ensure continuity.
- **System Integrity**: The bug undermines the integrity of the auction system, potentially leading to loss of trust among users and stakeholders if not adequately addressed.

## Code Snippet
- [`NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#_createAuction()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L247-L266)
```solidity
    function _createAuction() internal {
        try nouns.mint() returns (uint256 nounId) {
            uint40 startTime = uint40(block.timestamp);
            uint40 endTime = startTime + uint40(duration);

            auctionStorage = AuctionV2({
                nounId: uint96(nounId), //@audit
                clientId: 0,
                amount: 0,
                startTime: startTime,
                endTime: endTime,
                bidder: payable(0),
                settled: false
            });

            emit AuctionCreated(nounId, startTime, endTime);
        } catch Error(string memory) {
            _pause();
        }
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Assess the necessity and feasibility of adopting a larger data type for auction IDs, such as `uint256`, which provides a significantly higher limit.
Also Implement monitoring mechanisms to track the usage of auction IDs and proactively address potential limitations before reaching critical thresholds.
