# Potential `nextTokenId` Overflow in `registerClient` Function

## Summary
The `registerClient` function is vulnerable to a potential overflow of the `nextTokenId` variable, which is a `uint32`. If this variable overflows, it could lead to token ID collisions and disrupt the integrity of client token tracking.

## Vulnerability Detail
Current Implementation: The nextTokenId is incremented with each new client registration without bounds checks.

Issue: If `nextTokenId` reaches the maximum uint32 value `(4,294,967,295)` and overflows, it would reset to zero, leading to duplicate token IDs.

### PoC:
```solidity
function registerClient(string calldata name, string calldata description) external whenNotPaused returns (uint32) {
    RewardsStorage storage $ = _getRewardsStorage();

    uint32 tokenId = $.nextTokenId;
    $.nextTokenId = tokenId + 1; //@audit Potential overflow
    _mint(msg.sender, tokenId);
    // ...
}
```

## Impact
An overflow would result in the minting of NFTs with duplicate IDs, which could cause loss of rewards for clients and disrupt the rewards distribution mechanism.

## Code Snippet
- Refer to the PoC section above.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a check to ensure `nextTokenId` does not exceed the maximum value for uint32. Alternatively, consider using a larger data type like `uint256` for `nextTokenId` to avoid the overflow risk.
