# Proposal Submission, voting and auction rewards update could become really expensive in gas terms due to too many registered clients, approved or not

## Summary
With enough clients, Registered and unregistered, Auctions, and Proposal Submission and Voting can become really expensive (gas).

## Vulnerability Detail

When the Rewards contract is being updated for both auctions, and proposal submission and voting rewards, [`updateRewardsForAuctions()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/client-incentives/Rewards.sol#L230C5-L279C6) and [`updateRewardsForProposalWritingAndVoting()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/client-incentives/Rewards.sol#L307C1-L449C6) rewards clients that facilitated a successful auction, proposal or participated in the voting. Particularly for [`updateRewardsForProposalWritingAndVoting()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-nouns-dao-2/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/client-incentives/Rewards.sol#L307C1-L449C6), only the clients in the successful proposal is rewarded for proposal submission. To do this, the function loops through the client registered and update their reward balance.

```solidity
    function updateRewardsForAuctions(uint32 lastNounId) public whenNotPaused {
        .........
     uint256 numValues = m.numValues();
        for (uint32 i = 0; i < numValues; ++i) {
            ClientRewardsMemoryMapping.ClientBalance memory cb = m.getValue(i);
            uint256 reward = (cb.balance * auctionRewardBps) / 10_000;
            $._clientMetadata[cb.clientId].rewarded += SafeCast.toUint96(reward);

            emit ClientRewarded(cb.clientId, reward);
        ............
        }
```

The issue here is that the number of clients used in the loop is maxClient, which indicates that with more registered clients, approved or not, the number of times the loop happens also increases. With more loops comes more gas. And since a gas refund mechanism was implemented in the code, this is especially risky and could cause the refund value to be on the high side.

_As an after thought, the number of clients could be intentionally increased by a malicious actor who could just call registerClient() multiple times to register as many unapproved clients as possible to grief the system._

## Impact

Execution of reward update become really expensive. Plus, with gas refunds, the contract will definitely be draining more WETH than it ought to for gas refunds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Create an array of approved clients which we can loop through rather than through the list of both approved and unsanctioned clients
